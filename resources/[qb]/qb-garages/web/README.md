# QB Garages Web UI

This is the React/TypeScript web interface for qb-garages, built with Vite and Tailwind CSS.

## Development

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Start development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Build for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

The built files will be in the `dist` directory and are automatically used by the FiveM resource.

## Styling

This UI uses the same Tailwind CSS styling as qb-banking for consistency across the QB framework.
